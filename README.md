Maven is a strong choice for several reasons. Maven enforces a standard directory structure and naming conventions, which helps maintain consistency across projects. This "convention over configuration" approach means less time is spent on setup and configuration, and new developers can easily understand the structure of your project. For most common tasks, Mavenâ€™s conventions reduce the need for complex configurations, allowing developers to focus more on writing code than managing build processes.
Initially, the application encountered a failure to start due to Spring Boot's default behavior of trying to configure a DataSource. This happened because of the presence of the spring-boot-starter-data-jpa dependency, which automatically attempts to configure a database connection.
My solution was to exclude the DataSourceAutoConfiguration class from the application configuration to prevent Spring Boot from setting up a DataSource, as the project uses an in-memory list instead of a database.
It was assumed that for the scope of this project, a simple in-memory list would suffice to simulate a database for storing customer information. In a real-world application, this would be replaced by a relational database, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.
